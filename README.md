# Kyro's CS:GO Config Files

* Put these files in Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/cfg
* Be sure to add `+exec autoexec.cfg` to your [CS:GO launch options](https://dmarket.com/blog/csgo-launch-options/) through Steam
* Make sure to change at least the `sensitivity` value in autoexec.cfg to your preference. Most other options should be fine without change
